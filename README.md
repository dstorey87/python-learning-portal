# Python Foundations — Exercises & Tests

This pack contains small, focused exercises. Each exercise folder includes:
- `instructions.md` — what to implement
- `starter.py` — skeleton you edit
- `test.py` — run to verify (no external libs needed)

## How to run tests
In PowerShell:
```powershell
# Run a single exercise's tests
cd .\exercises\E2_username_slug
python test.py

# Or run them all
cd <this folder>
python run_all_tests.py
```
