## Known Issues & Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-Critical React Warnings
**Issue**: Console warnings about duplicate React keys  
**Impact**: No functional impact, development-only warnings  
**Severity**: Low  
**Action Required**: None for functionality, could be addressed in future development

**Sample Warning**:
```
Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `%s`. Keys should be unique...
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Monaco Editor Worker Warning
**Issue**: Monaco Editor web worker fallback warning  
**Impact**: No functional impact, editor works correctly  
**Severity**: Low  
**Action Required**: None, this is expected in certain deployment configurations

**Sample Warning**:
```
You must define a function MonacoEnvironment.getWorkerUrl or MonacoEnvironment.getWorker
```
